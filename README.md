# Interview Prep App

An application to help users prepare for interviews with practice tools, questions, and study support.

## Project Overview

This is an interview preparation app designed to offer practice questions, learning resources, and tools to help candidates sharpen their interview skills. The app includes basic UI components and backend logic to support interview study workflows.

## Features

- List of practice interview questions
- Simple UI for browsing and attempting questions
- Structured study flow for interview topics
- Starter code for adding more features

## Tech Stack

- Java (backend logic and core)
- HTML (frontend or UI pages)
- Maven for building and dependency management

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project locally you need:

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- A modern web browser (for any HTML UI components)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupanupranjan-gif/interview-prep-app.git
cd interview-prep-app
Build the project

Use Maven to compile and package the application:

mvn clean install
Run the app

After building, run the compiled JAR:

java -jar target/interview-prep-app.jar
This starts the application locally. If the project includes web UI files (like index.html), you can open these in a browser to view the interface.

Usage
Explore existing interview questions

Add new questions and answers (as supported)

Modify the code to expand features like categories, timed quizzes, or analytics
